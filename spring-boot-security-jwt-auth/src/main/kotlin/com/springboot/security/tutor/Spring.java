            Spring is a popular framework for building Java applications.
            It provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications,
            making it easier to create robust, maintainable, and scalable software.
            Here are some key features of Spring.
            """;
    String features = """
            1. Dependency Injection (DI):
                Spring promotes loose coupling through DI,
                allowing you to inject dependencies into your classes
                rather than hard-coding them.
            
            2. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):
                This allows you to separate cross-cutting concerns
                (like logging, security, and transaction management) from your business logic.
            
            3. Spring MVC:
                A powerful model-view-controller framework for building web applications.
                
            4. Spring Boot:
                Simplifies the development of new Spring applications by providing
                defaults for configuration and a wide range of production-ready features.
            
            5. Spring Data:
                Simplifies data access, working with relational and non-relational databases,
                map-reduce frameworks, and cloud-based data services.
                
            6. Spring Security:
                Provides comprehensive security services for Java applications,
                including authentication and authorization.
